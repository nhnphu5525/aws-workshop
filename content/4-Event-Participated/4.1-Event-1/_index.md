### Session Highlights

#### Amazon Bedrock Deep Dive
The morning session focused on Amazon Bedrock as a managed service for accessing foundation models. Key discussion points included model selection criteria between Claude, Llama, and other available models based on use case requirements. The speakers emphasized starting with smaller models for cost efficiency before scaling to larger ones.

#### Practical AI Implementation
Afternoon workshops covered real-world implementation patterns:
- Building conversational AI using Bedrock's API with Lambda backends
- Implementing RAG pipelines with Amazon OpenSearch for knowledge-based applications
- Cost management strategies including prompt caching and token optimization
- Security practices for handling sensitive data in AI workflows

#### Industry Applications
Several case studies were presented showing GenAI adoption across sectors:
- Financial services using document analysis for compliance
- E-commerce platforms implementing product recommendation systems
- Healthcare organizations deploying clinical documentation assistants

### Key Takeaways

The event reinforced that successful GenAI adoption requires balancing innovation with operational excellence. Most valuable was learning about common pitfalls in production deployments and strategies to avoid them.

1. **Start with clear use cases** - Focus on business problems rather than exploring technology for its own sake
2. **Invest in prompt engineering early** - Build evaluation frameworks from the beginning
3. **Monitor costs closely** - GenAI workloads can scale unexpectedly
