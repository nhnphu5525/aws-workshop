### Event Summary

An all-day workshop exploring DevOps practices and tooling on AWS. The session covered the complete DevOps lifecycle from source control through deployment and monitoring, with hands-on demonstrations and real-world case studies.

---

### Morning Session: CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code

#### CI/CD Pipeline Components
The workshop covered core AWS CI/CD services:
- **CodeCommit**: Git repository hosting with AWS integration
- **CodeBuild**: Managed build service with container support
- **CodeDeploy**: Automated deployment with multiple strategies
- **CodePipeline**: Orchestration of the complete workflow

#### Deployment Strategies
Three deployment approaches were compared:
- **Blue/Green**: Instant cutover with rollback capability
- **Canary**: Gradual traffic shift for risk reduction
- **Rolling**: Sequential instance updates

#### Infrastructure as Code
IaC tools discussed:
- **CloudFormation**: YAML/JSON declarative templates
- **AWS CDK**: Programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Java)
- **Terraform**: Multi-cloud infrastructure management

---

### Afternoon Session: Containers & Observability

#### Container Services
AWS container options:
- **ECS**: AWS-native orchestration for most use cases
- **EKS**: Kubernetes for complex multi-cloud requirements
- **App Runner**: Simplified deployment for web apps

#### Monitoring & Observability
Observability stack covered:
- **CloudWatch**: Metrics, logs, alarms, and dashboards
- **X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for microservices
- **Service Map**: Visual representation of service dependencies

---

### Key Takeaways

**Infrastructure & Deployment:**
- CDK offers better developer experience over raw CloudFormation
- Blue/Green deployments for zero-downtime releases
- Start with ECS unless specific Kubernetes requirements exist

**Observability:**
- CloudWatch for foundational monitoring
- X-Ray essential for microservices troubleshooting
- Build observability in from the start

**Case Study Results:**
- Startup achieved 3x improvement in deployment frequency
- Enterprise reduced time-to-market by 70%
- Both emphasized automation and cultural change
